                c) Arrays
                
a) LANGUAGE BASICS

1

Write a program that accepts two strings as command line arguments and generate the output in the required format

Example 1:

If the two command line arguments are Wipro and Bangalore then the output generated should be Wipro Technologies Bangalore.

Example 2:

If the command line arguments are ABC and Mumbai then the output generated should be ABC Technologies Mumbai
[Note: It is mandatory to pass two arguments in command line]

Command Line Argument
2

Write a program to accept string as a command line argument and print a welcome message as given below:

Example 1:

  C:\> java Sample John

  O/P Expected: Welcome John

Command Line Argument
3

Write a program to accept two integers as command line arguments and print the sum of the two numbers

Example 1:

  C:\>java Sample 10 20

  O/P Expected: The sum of 10 and 20 is 30

Command Line Argument

b) FLOW CONTROL STATEMENTS
1

Write a program to check if a given number is Positive, Negative, or Zero.

If Statement 	
2

Write a program to check if a given number is odd or even.

If Statement 	
3

Write a program to check if the program has received command line arguments or not. If the program has not received the values then print "No Values", else print all the values in a single line separated by ,(comma). Eg1) java Example O/P: No values Eg2) java Example Mumbai Bangalore O/P: Mumbai,Bangalore [Note: You can use length property of an array to check its length

If Statement 	
4

Initialize two character variables in a program and display the characters in alphabetical order. Eg1) if first character is s and second is e O/P: e,s Eg2) if first character is a and second is e O/P:a,e

If Statement 	
5

Intialize a character variable in a program and if the value is alphabet then print "Alphabet" if itâ€™s a number then print "Digit" and for other characters print "Special Character"

If Statement 	
6

Write a program to accept gender ("Male" or "Female") and age (1-120) from command line arguments and print the percentage of interest based on the given conditions. Interest == 8.2% Gender ==> Female Age ==>1 to 58 Interest == 7.6% Gender ==> Female Age ==>59 -120 Interest == 9.2% Gender ==> Male Age ==>1-60 Interest == 8.3% Gender ==> Male Age ==>61-120

If Statement 	
7

Write a program to convert from upper case to lower case and vice versa of an alphabet and print the old character and new character as shown in example (Ex: a->A, M->m).

If Statement 	
8

Write a program to print the color name, based on color code. If color code in not valid then print "Invalid Code". R->Red, B->Blue, G->Green, O->Orange, Y->Yellow, W->White.

Switch Statement 	
9

Write a program to print month in words, based on input month in numbers 
Example1:

 C:\>java Sample 12

 O/P Expected : December
 
Example2:

 C:\>java Sample 

 O/P Expected : Please enter the month in numbers
 
Example3:

 C:\>java Sample 15

 O/P Expected : Invalid month

For Loop 	
12

Write a program to check if a given number is prime or not

For Loop 	
13

Write a program to print prime numbers between 10 and 99.

For Loop 	
14

Write a Java program to find if the given number is prime or not.

Example1:

 C:\>java Sample 

 O/P Expected : Please enter an integer number 

Example2:

 C:\>java Sample 1

 O/P Expected : 1 is neither prime nor composite

Example3:

 C:\>java Sample 0

 O/P Expected : 0 is neither prime nor composite

Example4:

 C:\>java Sample 10

 O/P Expected : 10 is not a prime number

Example5:

 C:\>java Sample 7

 O/P Expected : 7 is a prime number

For Loop 	
15

Write a program to add all the values in a given number and print. Ex: 1234->10

For Loop 	
16

Write a program to print * in Floyds format (using for and while loop) *

Example1:

 C:\>java Sample 

 O/P Expected : Please enter an integer number

Example1:

 C:\>java Sample 3

 O/P Expected :

               *
               *  * 
               *  *  *

For Loop 	
17

Write a program that displays a menu with options 1. Add 2. Sub Based on the options chosen, read 2 numbers and perform the relevant operation. After performing the operation, the program should ask the user if he wants to continue. If the user presses y or Y, then the program should continue displaying the menu else the program should terminate. [ Note: Use Scanner class, you can take help from the trainer regarding the same ]
